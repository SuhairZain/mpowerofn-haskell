# mpowerofn-haskell
Just a "Hello World" program in Haskell to check if a number m is n raised to some number x

To try it,
1. Compile it using **ghc main.hs**
2. Run it using **./main _m_ _n_** in Linux and OSX or **main.exe _m_ _n_** in Windows

The output is as follows:
1. If a number *x* is found such that *m = n^x*, it is displayed
2. Otherwise, -1 is displayed
